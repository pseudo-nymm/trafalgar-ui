I created a responsive website front-end using React.js, Bootstrap, and Sass, following this Figma design named [Trafalgar Landing Page](https://www.figma.com/community/file/892358789568947362).
The webpage is available on Github Pages [here](http://pseudo-nymm.github.io/trafalgar-ui). This branch has the development build, 
while the gh-pages branch has the production build.
